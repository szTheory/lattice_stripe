# LatticeStripe

## What This Is

A production-grade, idiomatic Elixir SDK for the Stripe API. LatticeStripe is the default Stripe integration for the Elixir ecosystem — reliable enough for production SaaS, ergonomic enough that Elixir developers feel at home immediately. **Shipped v1.0.0 to Hex.pm on 2026-04-13** with full Payments + Billing + Connect coverage; four milestones later, the shipped 1.3.x surface is broad, documented, and discoverable. Hex package: `lattice_stripe`, module prefix: `LatticeStripe`.

## Core Value

Elixir developers can integrate Stripe payments into their applications with confidence — correct, well-documented, and unsurprising. **Still the right priority** — validated by four shipped milestones and a downstream consumer (Accrue) already building on top.

## Current State

**Active milestone:** v1.6 Tax — Phase 50 (Tax Settings & Registration) complete 2026-05-27. Next: Phase 51 (TaxId, Testing & Adoption Surface).

**Latest shipped milestone:** v1.5 Thin-Event Webhooks (archived 2026-05-27)

**What shipped in v1.5:**

- Thin-event SDK surface — `Webhook.parse_event_notification/4` (+ bang variant) verifies HMAC signatures and returns typed `EventNotification` structs exposing `id`, `type`, `created`, `context`, and a `related_object` reference, using the same error atoms as `construct_event/3`.
- Typed fetch-after-verify helpers — `Webhook.fetch_event/2,3` (`/v2/core/events/{id}`) and `Webhook.fetch_related_object/2,3` returning typed resources via the existing `ObjectTypes` registry (no new dispatch table), honoring per-request `:client`, `:api_version`, and `:idempotency_key`.
- `Event.t()` extended with a `related_object` field; net-new `EventNotification` + `EventNotification.RelatedObject` modules with custom `Inspect` impls; `ObjectTypes.fetch_module/1` typed-gate accessor.
- `Webhook.check_tolerance/2` `tolerance: 0` semantics reconciled across four surfaces (docstring, code clause, Plug NimbleOptions schema, tests) — `tolerance: 0` now disables the staleness check as the docstring promised, matching every canonical Stripe SDK. CHANGELOG entry + docs-truth grep regression lock the decision.
- Canonical guide `guides/webhooks-thin-events.md` published — Phoenix controller spine, fetch-after-verify, idempotency keyed on `event.id`, rate-limit guidance (<90/s), Connect/context-aware routing, verification-vs-payload-shape failure boundary; wired into ExDoc `Operations & DX` + README hardening-ops route + `guides/webhooks.md` closing section + JTBD Start Here Runtime route + Job 7 Read next.
- `LatticeStripe.Testing` thin-event helpers — `generate_thin_event_payload/3` (signed wire payload + matching `Stripe-Signature` header parseable by `parse_event_notification/4`) and `event_notification/1` (typed builder mirroring `dispute/1`/`customer/1`); snapshot helpers remain backwards-compatible.
- `test/lattice_stripe/webhook/thin_event_test.exs` chained Mox-at-Transport integration suite + five new docs-truth grep blocks (guide content lock, `~> 1.5` install canary, ExDoc placement, cross-link graph, Plug `@moduledoc` `tolerance: 0` testing-only).

**Outstanding follow-through (not milestone-blocking):**

- Phase `41.1` remains `pending-external-verification` for real-sandbox Quote downstream proof — an accepted external-proof boundary carried forward from v1.3, planned to ride along with v1.7 polish milestone.
- `mix.exs` still pinned at `@version "1.3.0"` — v1.5 is shipped in the planning sense (code merged, docs/tests green). The `@version` bump + `mix hex.publish` happens out-of-band when ready to cut the Hex release.

## Current Milestone: v1.6 Tax

**Goal:** Ship the Tax resource family as the broadest remaining mainstream Stripe family — SDK primitives only, with filing orchestration staying downstream in Accrue.

**Target features:**
- `Tax.Calculation` — calculate tax for a transaction without persisting
- `Tax.Transaction` — create, retrieve, and list tax transactions from calculations
- `Tax.Settings` — account-level tax configuration
- `Tax.Registration` — tax registration management
- `TaxId` — customer tax ID management (nested under `Customer` vs top-level — to decide in discuss-phase)

**Key context:**

- Largest of the planned remaining milestones (2-3 phases expected). Scope discipline must be negotiated in discuss-phase to prevent filing-strategy bleed into the SDK.
- Phase numbering continues from Phase 48 — v1.6 phases start at Phase 49.
- `Customer.tax_id` nested surface is a sub-decision worth its own discussion (Customer-scoped vs top-level `TaxId` resource).
- After v1.6 ships, only v1.7 (Polish & Operator) remains before the planned stop signal.

## Subsequent Milestones

1. **v1.7 — Polish & Operator** (small, ~1 phase) — fill the unusually thin `Charge` surface (`list/3`, `search/3`, `capture/4`, `update/4`), close Phase `41.1` honestly (re-run with valid sandbox creds or retire as accepted external-only follow-through), ship `guides/production-checklist.md` and `guides/event-debugging.md`. Planned stop signal for v1.x scope.

After v1.7, expect to publicly call the library "done for v1.x scope" absent fresh adopter pull. Identity / Treasury / Issuing / Terminal / Financial Connections / Climate / Sigma / Reporting stay deferred per JTBD doctrine.

## Context

**Ecosystem gap:** At project start, the Elixir ecosystem lacked a modern, maintained Stripe SDK. `stripity_stripe` was outdated, with known issues around nested encoding and stale API coverage. LatticeStripe fills that gap with a production-minded Elixir-first surface.

**Target users:** Elixir developers building SaaS products who need Stripe integrations that are correct, documented, and unsurprising. Early adopter signal remains strong: Accrue already consumes LatticeStripe as a downstream billing layer.

**Codebase scale (post-v1.5):** v1.5 added ~2,343 lines across 21 source files in a single-day milestone (2026-05-27, ~6 hours of focused work) on top of five prior milestones. Thin-event surface, fetch-after-verify helpers, and the canonical webhooks-thin-events guide are now first-class artifacts; the docs-truth contract has grown to 12 grep-locked tests across guide content, install canary, ExDoc placement, cross-link graph, and Plug moduledoc surfaces.

**Design philosophy:**

- Pure-functional core; processes only where the runtime boundary needs them
- Behaviours for extensibility (`Transport`, `RetryStrategy`, `Json`)
- `{:ok, result} | {:error, reason}` everywhere, with bang variants layered on top
- Pattern-matchable returns and explicit verbs for destructive or irreversible operations
- Principle of least surprise for Elixir developers

**Testing philosophy:**

- Integration specs first, with real request-pipeline proof where feasible
- Shift-left verification by default when a flow can be executed truthfully in CI
- Unit tests for pure logic and Mox for behaviour contracts
- Docs-truth assertions are first-class regression coverage, not editorial cleanup

## Constraints

- **Language**: Elixir 1.15+, OTP 26+
- **License**: MIT
- **No Dialyzer**: Typespecs remain documentation-first
- **HTTP**: Finch default transport behind a behaviour boundary
- **JSON**: Jason

### Active

(v1.6 Tax requirements — to be defined in REQUIREMENTS.md by this milestone's roadmapper run.)

### Out of Scope

- Billing-engine abstractions, entitlement logic, dunning workflows — belong downstream in Accrue or application code
- Resolving Phase 41.1 as a milestone-blocking requirement — real-sandbox proof remains valuable as carried follow-through, not as a release gate

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Handwritten v1 surface | Polish and Elixir ergonomics mattered more than breadth-first codegen | ✓ Good |
| Integration-first proof posture | Real boundaries catch drift earlier than mock-only tests | ✓ Good |
| Explicit verbs over magical updates | Clearer SDK semantics for irreversible actions | ✓ Good |
| Shift-left verification default | Docs/example flows should become executable proof where feasible | ✓ Good |
| Keep LatticeStripe lower-level than Accrue | Billing-engine abstractions belong downstream, not in the SDK | ✓ Good |
| Prioritize adoption closure before new breadth | Public truth and guide clarity unlock more value than another narrow Stripe family | ✓ Good (v1.4 confirmed) |
| Treat public docs/support truth as milestone-grade | First-run trust and flagship guidance change adoption more than another small API family | ✓ Good (v1.4 confirmed) |
| Keep recipe/operator guidance primitive-first | Recipes should stitch shipped primitives together without becoming an app workflow product | ✓ Good (v1.4 confirmed) |
| Treat the library as near-done for scope | Remaining leverage is adopter truth + selected wedges, not missing foundation | ✓ Good |
| Docs-truth as verifier-worthy regression surface | A green narrow docs test can still hide adopter-facing drift; v1.4 found `~> 1.2` drift while older assertions stayed green | ✓ Good (validated by Phase 43 find) |
| Preserve Phase 41.1 as `pending-external-verification` boundary | Real-sandbox proof is valuable but should not flatten into a false close; honesty over headline | ✓ Good (carried through v1.4) |
| Layered ExDoc grouping (Start Here / Canonical / Operations / Flagship) | Flat extras list buried high-leverage guides; role-based grouping surfaces the right surface for the right reader | ✓ Good (v1.4) |
| Webhook-confirmed truth posture in flagship guides | Accepted-now-vs-confirmed-by-webhook framing avoids overclaiming synchronous authority for async billing flows | ✓ Good (v1.4) |
| Lead post-adoption with thin-event webhooks, then Tax, then polish-and-stop | Thin events are mainstream Stripe direction; webhook foundation is already strong so the wedge is additive; Tax is the broadest remaining mainstream family but bigger; v1.7 polish gives the project an honest stop point at "done for v1.x scope" | ✓ Confirmed by v1.5 (shipped 2026-05-27 in ~6 hours single-day; surface landed clean with 21 tests added) |
| Verify shipped surface against `lib/` source before every new milestone | Planning artifacts can be coherent and still miss real code-truth gaps (v1.5 assessment found `Charge` is unusually thin and the `tolerance: 0` webhook bug stayed open through v1.4 — neither captured in planning docs alone) | ✓ Validated by v1.5 (`tolerance: 0` bug discovered by source verification, not planning review) |
| Reuse existing dispatch tables for new resource families instead of growing new ones | `Webhook.fetch_related_object/2,3` typed-dispatches via the existing `ObjectTypes` registry. Resisting "new dispatch table" temptation kept v1.5 narrow and made the surface immediately benefit from `ObjectTypes` typed deserialization | ✓ Good (v1.5) |
| Treat docstring/code drift as bug, not as docstring-fix opportunity | WEBFIX-01 chose to fix the code clause to match the docstring (matching every canonical Stripe SDK and the more useful semantics) instead of the easier path of changing the docstring. CHANGELOG + docs-truth grep regression locks the decision against future "fix it to be stricter" drift | ✓ Good (v1.5 WEBFIX-01) |
| Four-surface triangulation for security-adjacent bug fixes | WEBFIX-01 reconciled `tolerance: 0` across (1) source docstring, (2) source code clause, (3) `Webhook.Plug` NimbleOptions schema, (4) tests + CHANGELOG + docs-truth grep — the four surfaces an adopter touches to reach the behavior. Single-surface fixes leave drift seams | ✓ Good (v1.5 pattern, reusable for Charge surface work in v1.7) |
