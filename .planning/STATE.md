# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (reopened 2026-07-27 — v1.10 "Accrue Surface Closure" under adopter-pull gate, SEED-005)

**Core value:** Elixir developers can integrate Stripe payments into their applications with confidence — correct, well-documented, and unsurprising.
**Current focus:** Milestone complete

## Current Position

Phase: 61
Plan: Not started
Status: Milestone complete
Last activity: 2026-07-27 — Phase 63 planning complete

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.9):**

- Total phases: 2 (59–60)
- Total plans completed: 6
- Timeline: single-day (2026-05-27)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- **v1.10 reopens the build track** — adopter-pull gate fired (Accrue's verified blocking need for Stripe-native Entitlements); scope narrow + additive → Hex minor bump 1.8.0. Numbering diverges: GSD milestone v1.10, Hex tag 1.8.0 (v1.8/v1.9 were doc-only).
- **Wave 0 first** — default Finch pool (live footgun, DX-01) + "1.1 → 1.7 what landed" migration guide (DOC-01) are near-zero-code, de-risk, and unblock the most downstream accrue work.
- **Entitlements: pull/pagination shape only** — NO per-request `entitled?` gate helper (actively harmful for accrue's fail-closed local gate).
- **No new metering writes** — accrue uses exactly one (`MeterEvent.create/3`); all four write surfaces already ship. Only reads (EventSummary) are missing.
- **SEED-005 §6 stability contracts FROZEN** — nil `stripe_account` omits header; per-request opts override per-client; api_version default `2026-03-25.dahlia`; `Client.new!/1` takes a keyword list.
- **Lower-priority DX deferred to SEED-006** — brief §3.2, 3.5–3.9, 3.11 are real but non-blocking; not in this milestone.
- **v1.x stop signal otherwise holds** — no broad resource-family breadth (Identity, Treasury, Issuing, Terminal, etc.) in this reopen.
- [Phase ?]: Phase 61 default Finch pool: LatticeStripe.Application starts LatticeStripe.Finch at boot; :finch defaults to it (was required); opt-out via config :lattice_stripe, start_default_finch: false

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Requirement count**: REQUIREMENTS.md header says "17 v1 requirements" but the enumerated list contains **19 distinct IDs** (ENT×5, MTR×4, OBJ×3, PROD×2, DX×3, DOC×2). All 19 are mapped to phases (100% coverage). The "17" is a stale count in the source header, not a coverage gap.

## Operator Next Steps

**Default:** Plan and execute the v1.10 roadmap, Wave 0 first.

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Ready to plan | `/gsd-plan-phase 61` (default Finch pool) or `62` (migration guide) — both Wave 0 |
| Wave 0 done | `/gsd-plan-phase 63` (Entitlements flagship) |
| Bug / wrong Stripe behavior | `/gsd-quick` or `/gsd-debug` → fix + test |

**Do not:** broad resource-family breadth; new metering writes; a per-request `entitled?` gate helper; break SEED-005 §6 stability contracts.
